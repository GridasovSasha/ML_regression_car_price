In this project I implemented a car price prediction using linear regression with regularization (ridge regression)

Remark: comments in the code will be written in Russian

## IDA, feature transformation and ML model development
[main](main.ipynb) - The main code of the program is presented in this notebook. I performed reconnaissance analysis of the data, encoded the features of the object type and manually implemented a linear regression model with regularization.

## Result
The trained model was tested on a special set of test data and showed the following metric values:
- MAPE: 36%

At this stage, the model shows low quality and is planned to be improved
