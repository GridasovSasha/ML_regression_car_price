In this project I implemented a car price prediction using linear regression with regularization (ridge regression)

Remark: comments in the code will be written in Russian

## IDA, feature transformation and ML model development
[main](main.ipynb) - The main code of the program is presented in this notebook. I performed reconnaissance analysis of the data, encoded the features of the object type and manually implemented a linear regression model with regularization.
